#' @title calcMulticroppingYieldIncrease
#'
#' @description Calculates yield increase achieved through multiple cropping
#'              (as factor of off season to main season crop yield) under
#'              irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively.
#'              Optionally: return which grid cells are potentially suitable for
#'              multiple cropping activities under rainfed and irrigated conditions.
#'              Calculation is based on grassland gross primary production (GPP)
#'              in the growing period of the respective crop and annual grass GPP.
#'
#' @param selectyears   Years to be returned
#' @param lpjml         LPJmL version required for respective inputs as single string: "crop" version
#' @param climatetype   Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
#' @param fallowFactor  Factor determining yield reduction in off season due to
#'                      fallow period between harvest of first (main) season and
#'                      sowing of second (off) season
#' @param minThreshold  Minimum threshold of grass GPP in crop growing period
#'                      and crop yield to exclude low yielding cells
#'                      Unit of the threshold is gC/m^2.
#'                      Default: 100 gC/m^2
