\usage{
calcHalfEarth(cells = "magpiecell", nclasses = "seven")
}
\arguments{
\item{cells}{number of cells of landmask (select "magpiecell" for 59199 cells or "lpjcell" for 67420 cells)}

\item{nclasses}{Options are either "seven" or "nine".
\itemize{
\item "seven" separates primary and secondary forest and includes "crop", "past", "forestry",
"primforest", "secdforest", "urban" and "other"
\item "nine" adds the separation of pasture and rangelands, as well as a differentiation of
primary and secondary non-forest vegetation and therefore returns "crop", "past", "range",
"forestry", "primforest", "secdforest", "urban", "primother" and "secdother"
