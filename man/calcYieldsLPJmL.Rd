calcYieldsLPJmL(
  lpjml = "lpjml5.9.5-m1",
  climatetype = "MRI-ESM2-0:ssp370",

\arguments{
\item{lpjml}{Defines LPJmL version for main crop inputs}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios}

\item{selectyears}{Option to reduce number of years to be returned
(e.g., to avoid memory issues)}

\item{multicropping}{Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and
Multiple Cropping Suitability mask selected
(mask can be:
"none": no mask applied (only for development purposes)
"actual:total": currently multicropped areas calculated from total harvested areas
                and total physical areas per cell from readLandInG
"actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific),
"actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and irrigation-specific),
"potential:endogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
                        growing conditions from LPJmL
"potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
                       GAEZ suitability classification)
(e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)}

magpie object in cellular resolution

\description{
This function extracts yields from LPJmL in the first season (main growing period)
             and calculates the yields for the off season (second growing period)
