\item \code{"q33_marginal"}: The bottom tertile (suitability index below 0.13) of the marginal land area is excluded.
\item \code{"q50_marginal"}: The bottom  half (suitability index below 0.18) of the marginal land area is excluded.
\item \code{"q66_marginal"}: The first and second tertile (suitability index below 0.23) of the marginal land area are excluded.
\item \code{"q75_marginal"}: The first, second and third quartiles (suitability index below 0.25) of the marginal land are are excluded

\description{
Reads crop suitability data published in Zabel, F., Putzenlechner, B., & Mauser, W. (2014). Global Agricultural Land Resources â€“ A High Resolution Suitability Evaluation and Its Perspectives until 2100 under Climate Change Conditions. PLOS ONE, 9(9), e107522. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107522 and extracts the share of suitable cropland per grid cell, depending on different suitability thresholds.
