\usage{
readZabel2014(subtype = "all_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated")
}
\arguments{
\item{subtype}{Defines which share of marginal land should be included (see options below) and
               whether suitable land under irrigated conditions ("irrigated"), under rainfed conditions ("rainfed")
               or suitability under rainfed conditions including currently irrigated land (rainfed_and_irrigated)
               should be used. Options combined via ":"
               The different marginal land options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all_marginal"}: All marginal land (suitability index between 0-0.33) is included as suitable
\item \code{"q33_marginal"}: The bottom tertile (suitability index below 0.13) of the
marginal land () area is excluded.
\item \code{"q50_marginal"}: The bottom half (suitability index below 0.18) of the
marginal land area is excluded.
\item \code{"q66_marginal"}: The first and second tertile (suitability index below 0.23) of
the marginal land area are excluded.
\item \code{"q75_marginal"}: The first, second and third quartiles (suitability index below 0.25)
of the marginal land are are excluded
\item \code{"no_marginal"}: Areas with a suitability index of 0.33 and lower are excluded.

Reads crop suitability data published in Zabel, F., Putzenlechner, B., & Mauser, W. (2014).

2100 under Climate Change Conditions. PLOS ONE, 9(9), e107522. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107522
and extracts the share of suitable cropland per grid cell, depending on different suitability thresholds.
