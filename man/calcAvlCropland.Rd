calcAvlCropland(
  marginal_land = "magpie",
  cell_upper_bound = 0.9,
  cells = "magpiecell",
  country_level = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{marginal_land}{different options are
\itemize{
\item \code{"all_marginal"}: Include all marginal land
\item \code{"q33_marginal"}: The bottom tertile of the marginal land area is excluded
\item \code{"q50_marginal"}: The bottom  half of the marginal land area is excluded
\item \code{"q66_marginal"}: The first and second tertile of the marginal land area are excluded
\item \code{"q75_marginal"}: The first, second and third quartiles of the marginal land are are excluded
\item \code{"no_marginal"}: Marginal land is fully excluded
\item \code{"magpie"}: Returns "all_marginal", "q33_marginal" and "no_marginal" in a magclass object to be used as magpie input.
}}

\item{cell_upper_bound}{Upper bound for cropland at the grid cell level.
Even if, for instance, the total available cropland area equals the land area in a grid cell,
cropland cannot be expanded above this value.}

\item{cells}{magpiecell (59199 cells) or lpjcell (67420 cells)}

\item{country_level}{Whether output shall be at country level.
Requires aggregate=FALSE in calcOutput.}
}
\value{
magpie object in cellular resolution
}
\description{
Calculates the total available cropland per grid cell,
             based on physical cropland suitability data or other criteria,
             such as constraints on cropland expansion
