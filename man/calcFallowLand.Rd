\description{
Calculates fallow land on grid cell level,
based on physical cropland extend and harvested area output
of LPJML io toolbox.
The formula
"fallow land are = max( physical cropland area - harvested cropland area, 0)"
is used.
Due to multiple cropping, harvested cropland area can be greater than non-fallow land area
and even greater than physical cropland area.
Thus the results can only be considered a rough estimate of fallow land area.
