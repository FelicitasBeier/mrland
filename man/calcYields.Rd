calcYields(
  source = c(lpjml = "ggcmi_phase3_nchecks_9ca735cb", isimip = NULL),
  climatetype = "GSWP3-W5E5:historical",

}
\arguments{
\item{source}{Defines LPJmL version for main crop inputs and isimip replacement.
For isimip choose crop model/gcm/rcp/co2 combination formatted like this:
"yields:EPIC-IIASA:ukesm1-0-ll:ssp585:default:3b"}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios}

\item{cells}{if cellular is TRUE: "magpiecell" for 59199 cells or "lpjcell" for 67420 cells}

\item{weighting}{use of different weights (totalCrop (default),
totalLUspecific, cropSpecific, crop+irrigSpecific,
avlCropland, avlCropland+avlPasture)}

\item{multicropping}{Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and
Multiple Cropping Suitability mask selected
(mask can be:
"none": no mask applied (only for development purposes)
"actual:total": currently multicropped areas calculated from total harvested areas
                and total physical areas per cell from readLanduseToolbox
"actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific),
"actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and irrigation-specific),
"potential:endogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
                        temperature and productivity limits
"potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
                       GAEZ suitability classification)
(e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)}

\item{indiaYields}{if TRUE returns scaled yields for rainfed crops in India}

\item{scaleFactor}{integer value by which indiaYields will be scaled}

\item{marginal_land}{Defines which share of marginal land should be included (see options below) and
               whether suitable land under irrigated conditions ("irrigated"), under rainfed conditions ("rainfed")
               or suitability under rainfed conditions including currently irrigated land (rainfed_and_irrigated)
               should be used. Options combined via ":"
               The different marginal land options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all_marginal"}: All marginal land (suitability index between 0-0.33) is included as suitable
\item \code{"q33_marginal"}: The bottom tertile (suitability index below 0.13) of the
marginal land area is excluded.
\item \code{"q50_marginal"}: The bottom  half (suitability index below 0.18) of the
marginal land area is excluded.
\item \code{"q66_marginal"}: The first and second tertile (suitability index below 0.23) of
the marginal land area are excluded.
\item \code{"q75_marginal"}: The first, second and third quartiles (suitability index below 0.25)
of the marginal land are are excluded
\item \code{"no_marginal"}: Areas with a suitability index of 0.33 and lower are excluded.
\item \code{"magpie"}: Returns "all_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated",
                       "q33_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated" and
                       "no_marginal:rainfed_and_irrigated" in a magclass object to be used as magpie input.

\description{
This function extracts yields from LPJmL
             and transforms them to MAgPIE crops calibrating proxy crops
             to FAO yields. Optionally, ISIMIP yields can be returned.
