\usage{
readBrennan2022(subtype = "KBA_GSN_masked")
}
\arguments{
\item{subtype}{Defines whether land area covered by Critical Connectivity Areas has
been masked by other conservation priority data. If Key Biodiversity Areas have
only been masked the option is \code{"KBA_masked"}. With \code{"KBA_GSN_masked"}, land
area covered by the Global Safety Net (distinct species assemblages cluster) is also
masked. This is useful for complementary scenario building.}
}
\value{
Returns magpie objects with the land area covered by Critical Connectivity areas
 that is NOT already covered by Key Biodiversity Areas or the Global Safety Net
 (distinct species assemblages cluster) and was unprotected in 2020.
}
\description{
Reads Critical Connectivity Areas as defined in Brennan, A.,
Naidoo, R., Greenstreet, L., Mehrabi, Z., Ramankutty, N., & Kremen, C. (2022).
Functional connectivity of the world’s protected areas. Science, 376(6597),
1101–1104. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abl8974
Protected areas (2020) and Key Biodiversity Areas/Global Safet Net areas were masked at
a spatial resolution of 10 arc seconds before aggregating the data to 0.5°.
