\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{output}{"multicroppingSuitability": returns magpie object 
indicating which grid cells are suitable for multiple cropping, 
"multicroppingYieldIncreaseFactor": factor to determine 
off season yield based on grass GPP}

\item{minThreshold}{Threshold of grass GPP in crop growing period to be 
considered suitable for multiple cropping.
Unit of the threshold is gC/m^2.
Default: 100gC/m^2}

\item{addHarvest}{Minimum additional harvest factor (grassGPPannual / grassGPPgrper)
to be considered suitable for multiple cropping}

\item{fallowFactor}{Factor determining yield reduction in off season due to
fallow period between harvest of first (main) season and
sowing of second (off) season}

\description{
Calculates yield increase achieved through multiple cropping 
             (as factor of off season to main season crop yield) under 
             irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively. 
             Optionally: return which grid cells are potentially suitable for 
             multiple cropping activities under rainfed and irrigated conditions.
             Calculation is based on grassland gross primary production (GPP)
             in the growing period of the respective crop and annual grass GPP.
